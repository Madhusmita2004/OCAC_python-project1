Real Estate Data Analysis App

Project Overview

This project provides a Streamlit-based web application for analyzing real estate data. It allows users to explore property trends, analyze pricing patterns, and gain insights into factors affecting real estate prices.

Features

Upload and process real estate datasets

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Handle missing values and encode categorical data

Filter and analyze property trends based on location, size, and price

Interactive UI using Streamlit

How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd real-estate-analysis

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment:

On Windows:

python -m venv venv

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run app.py

Usage

Once the Streamlit app is running, you can:

Upload your own dataset

Explore property price distributions

Visualize trends in the dataset

Future Enhancements

Implementing machine learning models for price prediction
